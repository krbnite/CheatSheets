# Keyboard Commands

## Modes

* Switch from Edit Mode (Green) to Command Mode (Blue): <esc>
* Switch from Command Mode (Blue) to Edit Mode (Green):  <enter>

## Navigation
The following commands  assume you are in Command Mode.  

* Move up a cell: k
* Move down a cell: j


## Adding Cells
To avoid write <esc> too many times, the commands below assume you are already in Command 
Mode.  If you are in Edit Mode, these commands work by first escaping into Command Mode w/ <esc>.

* Add cell above current cell: a
* Add cell below current cell: b
* Delete current cell: dd

## Copying, Yanking, and Pasting Cells
There are technically commands for these things... But they don't seem to work for me, e.g.,
from what I can tell, cmd+c should copy a cell in Command Mode and cmd+v should paste it.  For me,
nothing happens......

That said, you can still copy and paste text in Edit Mode.
